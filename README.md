## Welcome

Hallo there, thanks for reading or something

I program mostly in Python and I make some stuff for the discord bot [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), which has an amazing community around it.

Whilst not building discord bots I am commiting acts of heresy by rewriting perfectly fine code into a single line, which, although at first simplistic, becomes an enormous monster that cannot be stopped. You can see my handywork on this at [my fork of Red's Lavalink library](https://github.com/Just-Jojo/Red-Lavalink)

Have fun!
