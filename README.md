Hi there. I code stuff (normally in Python) and sometimes it works. I really like Discord bots for... some... reason, and I like to help other people with their coding questions/problems.

Apparently, I understand a lot of stuff (which I guess is true) and I am sorta helpful for people.

I mainly code in Python but know a bit about JavaScript, Java, and C#.

I am normally not this professional and I hate being professional but this is GitHub and I don't want everyone to think I'm a weirdo...

If you have an issue don't be afraid to make an issue on the repo and let me know

#### Discord stuff
My username is `Jojo#7791` and you can find me on [Red - DiscordBot's server](https://discord.gg/red) or my [friend's server](https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7) and contact me there

## Thanks for reading this!
